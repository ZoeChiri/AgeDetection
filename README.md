# AgeDetection

## Overview
AgeDetection is a deep learning project aimed at accurately predicting the age of individuals from images. This project serves as a practice for implementing various deep learning techniques and models for age estimation.

## Features
- Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for age prediction.
- Supports training on custom datasets.
- Allows camera useage to upload your own photo.
- Pre-trained models available for quick testing.

## Installation 

#WIP
